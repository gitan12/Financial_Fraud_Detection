# PaySim-Fraud-Detection

## Welcome to the GitHub Repository for the Mobile Money Fraud Detection Project

This project delves deep into the realm of synthetic financial transactions using the PaySim dataset. The goal is to develop and evaluate machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to detect fraudulent activities in mobile money transactions. The dataset provides a simulated environment that mirrors real-world transaction patterns, making it an invaluable resource for researchers and data scientists focused on fraud detection.

## Overview of the PaySim Mobile Transactions Dataset

The PaySim dataset represents a significant step forward for those in financial technology, particularly in mobile money transactions where public datasets are scarce. By simulating real transaction data and incorporating synthetic fraud patterns, this dataset serves as a crucial tool for developing and testing fraud detection algorithms.

## Project Components

### Data Preparation
The project begins with meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the dataset is well-suited for modeling. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical values to improve algorithm performance.

### Machine Learning Model Development
We employ various machine learning techniques, focusing on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) due to their proficiency in handling nonlinear data and their capacity for learning complex fraud patterns. The models are trained and tested using a split of the dataset to ensure they generalize well on unseen data.

### Fraud Detection Analysis
The ANN models are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions. Insights drawn from model predictions help in understanding the characteristics of fraudulent activities within the dataset.

### Comparative Analysis
Alongside ANNs, other machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forests and Logistic Regression are also explored. A comparative analysis of these models provides a comprehensive view of their strengths and weaknesses in fraud detection.

### Implementation of Model Tuning and Optimization
To enhance model performance, techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and ensemble methods are implemented. These optimizations are crucial for improving the detection rates of fraudulent transactions.

## Conclusion

This machine learning project leverages the synthetic PaySim dataset to illustrate the potential of advanced analytics in tackling fraud in the mobile money sector. The models developed here serve as a foundational step for financial institutions looking to enhance their fraud detection capabilities.

Feel free to explore the code and models, and contribute to this ongoing effort to secure financial transactions in an increasingly digital world!
